# CMPE 172 - Starbucks Project - Personal Journal - Daniel Saneel

This is a weekly personal journal that describes the weekly tasks,challenges, and accomplishmets for Daniel's Contributions.

## Week 1 (Project Kickoff)

The team had meetings on how to layout the project and how to divide and assign tasks.

I assisted in the discussion on how we can divide tha major front-end and back-end tasks and assign accordingly.

On further discussion, we came to a conclusion that Taarush & I, would be working on putting up the back-end architecture, and Martin would coordinate the front-end development, and the entire team would help with the cloud deployment once the initial app is put together.
