![week1-taskboard](../Images/week1-taskboard.png)

Our primary progress this week revolved around understanding the project requirement and setting goals inorder to submit a scalable and reliable project submission. Moreover we went over everyone's availability inorder to make a schedule that would get us on the track to finishing our project on time. 

My responsibilities and first tasks include working with Daniel to build the backend of the application while also assisting Martin, who is working on the front end, when it comes to fullstack integration. 

Aside from that, I also thoroughly reviewed previous Spring labs and the various Database related labs to get a better understanding on what is required for the project. More importantly to understand which parts of the project we already have a decent grip on and parts of the project which require more research and prototyping. 


Personal Accomplishments for Week (04/22):
* Scoping requirements of the entire project in order to assign individual tasks

Challenges
