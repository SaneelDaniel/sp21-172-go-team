### WEEK 1 (4/16/21 - 4/21/21)

 - 4/16/21: Brainstorming and discussing project tasks to assign to each member.

 - 4/16/21: Distributing tasks between Daniel, Taarush, and myself. I will be working on the front end while Daniel and Taarush will deal with the backend.

 - 4/18/21: So far, I am currently in the process of building the cashier page on the front end as well as the customer page. 

**Challenges** 

 - Adding different components to the cashier page was resulting in styling errors, so I had to manually debug it to display correctly. 

**Planned Next Week** 

 - Task1 : Begin building the boilerplate of the app. Build the template for home page, the template page that will be displaying all the drinks, and finally the checkout page.

 - Task2 : Style the page as needed. Add logos, animations, and various styles that are relevant to the Starbucks image.

Summary: 

Last week our group spent the majority of time dealing with the scope of the project to make a taskboard to help us submit our project on time. We decided that I would be focusing thoroughly on the front end while Taarush and Daniel would be splitting the back-end work. Referencing the assigned tasks, I worked on setting up the front end for both the Cashier page layout and the BackOffice page layout. 

My progress on this can be tracked on [branch](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-go-team/tree/martinvlad). We collectively agreed that we will all work seperately until we can merge the entire project on the main branch.

Personal Accomplishments: 
 - Completed the Cashier front end page layout. Working on customizing it with the Spring framework shortly.

 - Completed the BackOffice front end page layout. Will be editing this once Taarush/Daniel is done customizing the backend to make sure the routes hit correctly.

**Challenges**

 - Integrating the front end with the Spring framework correctly.
 - Making sure that the site is responsive on all devices.
 - Ensuring that we all work on seperate features to avoid merge conflicts/errors.
