Martin Vladimirov

WEEK 1 (4/16/21 - 4/21/21)

 - 4/16/21: Brainstorming and discussing project tasks to assign to each member.

 - 4/16/21: Distributing tasks between Daniel, Taarush, and myself. I will be working on the front end while Daniel and Taarush will deal with the backend.

So far, I am currently in the process of building the cashier page on the front end as well as the customer page. 

**Challenges** 

 - Adding different components to the cashier page was resulting in styling errors, so I had to manually debug it to display correctly. 

**Planned Next Week** 

 - Task1 : Begin building the boilerplate of the app. Build the template for home page, the template page that will be displaying all the drinks, and finally the checkout page.

 - Task2 : Style the page as needed. Add logos, animations, and various styles that are relevant to the Starbucks image.
